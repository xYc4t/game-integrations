## Integration

Add dpatchz module to your package inputs:

    "inputs": {
        "dpatchz": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/dpatchz/dpatchz.luau"

local dpatchz = import("dpatchz")
```

## Examples

```luau
local dpatchz = import("dpatchz")

dpatchz.patch_file(diff_path, old_path, new_path) -- will execute `dpatchz $diff_path $old_path $new_path`

dpatchz.patch_file(diff_path, base_path) -- will execute `dpatchz -i $diff_path $base_path`
```
